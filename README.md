# Movie Filtering Application

This project was created using React and Framer Motion for the animations. It is a single-page application that lets you filter movies according to their categories. The movies are retrieved from The Movie Database with fetch(). Hooks, such as useState and useEffect have been used to display the data retrieved from the fetch call. No other library was used except plain CSS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
